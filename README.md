# MNIST Digit Classification

## Description
This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a benchmark in computer vision and machine learning, consisting of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits.  

The model in this project is designed to:  
- Accurately recognize handwritten digits in grayscale images.  
- Generalize well on unseen data thanks to data preprocessing and augmentation.  
- Serve as an educational example for learning CNNs and PyTorch workflows.  
- Provide a foundation for more advanced digit or character recognition tasks.

This project demonstrates the complete workflow, including:  
- Data loading, normalization, and augmentation.  
- CNN architecture with convolutional layers, pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers.  
- Training with validation, early stopping, and saving the best model.  
- Preprocessing images for prediction with the trained model.
